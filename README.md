# 🕌 Azkar Counter Web App

A simple and clean HTML/CSS/JS-based Azkar (Islamic remembrance) counter. This project contains two types of dhikr (ذكر): **استغفار** (seeking forgiveness) and **تسبيح** (glorifying Allah). Users can click to count repetitions and reset when needed.

## 🌐 Demo Pages

- **Homepage (Main Menu):** `index.html`  
  Offers buttons to navigate to:
  - استغفار (Astaghfar)
  - تسبيح (Tasbeeh)

- **استغفار Page:** `1.html`  
  - Button labeled "استغفر الله" increases the count.
  - Button labeled "اعادة" resets the counter.
  - Shows the count value.
  - Link to return to main menu.

- **تسبيح Page:** `1 copy.html`  
  - Same logic and layout as above, with the button labeled "سبحان الله".

## 💡 Features

- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Optimized for different screen sizes.
- 🎨 **Simple & Elegant UI** – Clean layout with soft background and button styling.
- 🧠 **Vanilla JS** – No libraries or frameworks; pure JavaScript logic.
- 🔄 **Counter Functionality** – Increment and reset with a single click.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Navigate between Azkar types using the buttons.
